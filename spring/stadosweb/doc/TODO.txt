STANDING QUESTIONS

- how do we want to deal with input (pros/cons/real estate)

- leave coupons as is or integrate further (add into categories, track etc...)

- how's the budget

- add notes/news/bulletin?
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
TODOS

- encrypt/encode all general packets from mobile clients

- generate encrypted interface for card submissions

- md5 the password before sending

- generate interface for stylus signatures

- add IP checking for administrative or non-session services (like register),
	so that these can only be performed from trusted machines (add interface for
	trusted machines).  a script could register any number of bad users...

- implement delta logic for invoice addition

- add support for voiding/comping invoice items and debug
	- mobile
	- webapp DONE

- add support for coupons, invoice credits...
	- mobile DONE
	- webapp 

- add pricing back into the app itemized/billed tracking (subtotal, taxing, etc...)
	- mobile
	- webapp 

- ensure all hotspots are not repainting (recycle 'em)

- integrate paging
	- mobile
	- webapp

- obfuscate js files

- add watchdog for session issue (long-term idle state kills first transaction)

- add unique titles, so system not dependent upon ids

- add jta support due to financial involvement

- implement the 'named pipe' and address binding (no tcp/ip networking, what about port redirects?)

- lock out all unnecessary services for the production machine, in the name of security and performance
	(generate a list)	
	
- noodle details for application monitor/launcher to work for initialization, backup and shutdown of the
	manager

- generate jmeter runs to test concurrency support

- generate database integrity scripts (python)

- ** address logic when deleting a product, following things have occurred:
		- the associated category also deletes (fix by cascade setting)

- add cleanup in the mobile client (no finalization in j2me)

- lock down directory listings; remove ability to load app from server (/stadosweb/intall)

- introduce the obfuscation step in build cycle

- writeup a 'getting started' page, giving basic instructions for creating and managing
	an ideal stados instance
	
- see if i can reduce the override enum to int in the database (rather than varchar255)

DONES

done - alterations for initial ui suggestions

done - refactor webapp controller for named method calling, to get rid of the 'else' spaghetti

done - change ids to Long type in domain objects (just annoying)

done - refactor model to utilize annotations for flexibility

done - refactor model to add support for num (same) items (i.e. 2 ice tea, etc...) and details

done - setup standalone server for long-term observation

done - change product page to add category as a dropdown and remove 'description'

done - change category page to create a list (remove membership additions, etc... too clumsy)
	NOTE: this removes flexibility for multiple categories for a given product
	
done - add service queues for the following (maybe persist):
	pending orders (unserved)
	served orders

done - add 'served' and 'closed' states/indicators to invoices to move order off queue and export invoices
	for completion/processing, respectively
	
done - integrate hotspot object with mobile client for generalized touchpoints and precise coords (custom screens)

done - add reload to order queue, allowing update every 5 sec?

done - debug mobile usage printouts; add options button for exit/options

done - timestamp at expedite

done - add support for manager-only operations on the mobile client
