cse434 - assignment 1b.

My code generates the simulation as close
to specs as possible.  The only output
of the program is written to std.out, I
didn't have time to produce plots as
asked.  All documentation can be found
within the source file itself.

Command line:

java Macsim load

load:	1 = 100kbps
	2 = 500kbps
	3 = 1mbps


there ya have it.
